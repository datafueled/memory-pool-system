How to make an MPS release for Configura.  

This document tells you how to make a new release of the MPS for Configura.  It assumes that the source-code work (the reason for the new release) is in master sources already.  

Readership: MPS staff.  Confidential: no.  Status: rough notes, informally peer-reviewed.  Author: RHSK.

Background: refer to PQTCM ("Product Quality Through Change Management", <http://www.ravenbrook.com/doc/1999/05/20/pqtcm/>) for background, terminology, rationale, and usage guidance.  This tells you what "a release" actually is.

__OVERVIEW__

Steps:

1. (optional) make a new version: see <procedure/version-create/>

2. check the diffs: eg. "p4 diff2 -q version/1.105/... version/1.106/...".

3. get the equipment ready: see __EQUIPMENT__ below.

4. test the new code: see <code/tool/testrunner.py>

5. build the release: see __BUILD__ below.


__EQUIPMENT__

You need a Windows box.  I used a PC with P4, VisualC++, and cygwin on it already.  

Set-up a login and password if necessary.  To prevent pwd expiry, use Start > Programs > Admin Tools > User Manager.  To make cmd windows tab-complete filenames, do this:  Start > Run > regedit.  HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > Microsoft > Command Processor > CompletionChar = 9.  

If you want to access remotely from a Mac, use "Chicken of the VNC", eg. 2.02b2.  You'll need the VNC session-password (not the same as your NT login password).  Remember how to escape from Full-screen: Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-` (backquote); and how to right-click: depress and release Shift-key, then click.  

To copy ad-hoc files (like build output) to and from a Mac, mount the PC's disk on your Mac.  Finder > Go > Network > Network > Ravenbrook > PC.  Be patient: list of servers may take some seconds to fully update/populate.  For a machine in its own workgroup, it may be more like Finder > Go > Network > Network > Workgroup > PC.  By default XP has "simple file-sharing", so if you share the whole disk you still don't share stuff in Documents and Settings.  To fix this: turn off "simple file-sharing" by clearing the check-box at Control Panel > Folder Options > View > "Use simple file sharing (Recommended)"; and go back to the share point (eg. C:\) > Properties > Sharing > Permissions, and make it PC\Users who have access (not Everyone).  

Start > Programs > P4Win.  Set-up a P4 client.  Set-up the client map.  P4sync to check it's working.  

Or, for command-line p4, first need to do "p4 set" to set P4USER, P4CLIENT, and P4PORT (eg. "p4 set P4USER=rhsk").  This sets things in the registry, so it is persistent.  


__BUILD__

Read all of <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-build/>, which is the normal release-build procedure.  Keeping referring to it during this procedure.  The following notes are just a delta from it.  

First, clean out the place code will be built in, and sync to the right changelevel (the changelevel you have decided is going to be the release's origin).  

cd code

You may need to do "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\vcvars32.bat".  (This also sets up the path so you can just type "nmake").  

Invoke w3build.

(
you might think that "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\nmake.exe" /f w3i3mv.nmk
is right, but no, you want:  //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/code/w3build.bat
)

This makes a release directory, eg:
duck:/Volumes/PC-C/rhsk/master/code/release richardk$ find . '-type' d '-print'
.
./include
./lib
./lib/w3i3
./lib/w3i3/ce
./lib/w3i3/ci
./lib/w3i3/we
./lib/w3i3/wi
./src

Make a tar archive of the release directory.  (PC needs cygwin, which includes GNU tar, etc.).  Use this command:
  "tar cfz MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.tgz release"
A.BBB.C is the release name.  DDDDDD is the release origin changelevel.  

p4 add this under mps/release.  (It's your first candidate build for release A.BBB.C).  

Test it.  (Copy to new place and extract with "tar xfz MMconfigura-A.BBB.C-DDDDDD.tgz"; note: do not use auto-complete on the tgz filename, because a full pathname confuses tar.  Consider using tool/test-runner.py to run various tests, repeatedly.)

Once successfully tested, update infosys.  See <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-build/>.  Remember to update issue.cgi.  

Make sure it is sync'd to www.ravenbrook.com.  (As of 2006, this should happen automatically every 10 minutes).  Then send an email with a pointer to the release.  

(You could also send it attached to a separate email.  But this is NOT reliable: it may get stuck in a virus filter.)

END OF PROCEDURE
